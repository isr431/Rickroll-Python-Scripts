# Rickroll-Python-Scripts
A collection of Rickroll scripts. Includes two Python scripts and an executable file.

'Basic' uses the webbrowser module to open the YouTube link.
'Advanced' uses the pynput module to simulate keypresses of the volume up key to maximise the volume.

The executable file functions identically to the 'Advanced' Python script. Converted to a .exe file using pyinstaller, but may face issues with Windows Security.
